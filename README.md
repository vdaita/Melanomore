## Problem
According to the Google post “Using Deep Learning to Inform Differential Diagnoses of Skin Diseases”, an estimated 1.9 billion people worldwide suffer from a skin condition at any given time, and due to a shortage of dermatologists, many cases are seen by general practitioners instead. A common skin disease, melanoma, was expected to have 7000 deaths this year (curemelanoma.org). 

## Solution
A mobile application that anyone can download and use that allows them to use the latest research to detect the skin disease(s) that they have.
